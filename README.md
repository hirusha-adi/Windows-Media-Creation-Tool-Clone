# Windows Media Creation Tool Knockoff

This tool is designed to mimic the original Windows Media Creation Tool interface while allowing for the execution of its functions in the background through new threads. All functions contained within the classes of the Python files located within the modules folder will be executed in the background. To exclude specific functions from running, the function name should be added to the `modules/exclude.py` file.

It is recommended to customize the code to meet specific requirements and maximize its potential.

Please note that the aforementioned tool is not intended for malicious purposes, and its use for any such activities is strongly discouraged. As the developer of the tool, I hold no responsibility for any actions taken by others using it.
