# windows-11-setup-virus
THIS IS A VIRUS AND THIS WILL HARM YOUR COMPUTER!

I tried as hard as i can to clone the Windows 10 Download tool ( downloaded from: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10 ) with Python and Tkinter. The GUI iteself is not dangerous at all! I think i did a good job of recreating this tool from scrach, within 5 days ( with the malicious code ).

# Malicious Code
EVERY THING IS DONE WITH THE malicious_code_file.py. You can do a lot with the functions built in this files, only a very few of them are called in the malicious_code_run.py ( this is the file you have to run to start the code )

Every function in "malicious_code_file.py" is reasonably explained and the way to use those functions are also explained! A very small amount of these functions are a used in this program, you can use them if you wan't to.

# NOTE
I am not responsible for anything done with this!

# How to make an .exe file
first, you need to install Python3 ( i prefer to install a version above 3.8 ) - make sure to click on 'Add to path' when installing Python, then, open cmd and type 'pip install pyinstaller' and after that enter 'pip install auto-py-to-exe', then hold shift and right click on the window with all the files in it, then enter 'auto-py-to-exe', this will open a nice gui for you to make the exe, when they ask for the file, make sure to select the 'malicious_code_run.py' file.. ( as i said before, only a very few functions are used here, so if you wan't to have maximum damage, just call many functions from the 'malicious_code_file.py' file )


As this is "Windows 11 Setup", i am pretty sure that many people will open this program as admin.
