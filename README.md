THIS IS A VIRUS AND THIS WILL HARM YOUR COMPUTER!

I tried as hard as i can to clone the Windows 10 Download tool ( downloaded from: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10 ) with Python and Tkinter. The GUI iteself is not dangerous at all! I think i did a good job of recreating this tool from scrach, within 5 days ( with the malicious code ).

# Malicious Code
EVERY THING IS DONE WITH THE malicious_code_file.py

Every function in "alicious_code_file.py" is resonably explained and the way to use those functions are also explained! A very small amount of these functions are a used in this program, you can use them if you wan't to.
