"""
Special thanks to PAGE for their contribution to this project. 
The GUI files included in this code were built on top of 
TCL/Tkinter for Python and were built using the PAGE editor.

PAGE is a cross-platform drag-and-drop GUI generator, bearing 
a resemblance to Visual Basic. It allows one to easily create
Python GUI windows containing a selection of Tk and ttk widgets.
